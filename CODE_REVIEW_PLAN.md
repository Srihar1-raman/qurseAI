# üîç Code Review Plan - Industry Standards Assessment

**Goal**: Ensure Qurse follows industry best practices, is maintainable, scalable, and secure.

---

## üìä Assessment Strategy

I recommend reviewing **by functional areas** rather than file-by-file or flow-by-flow. This is more efficient and helps identify patterns.

### Review Order (Most Critical First):

1. **Security & Authentication** ‚ö†Ô∏è (Most important)
2. **Error Handling & Validation**
3. **Database Patterns & Data Integrity**
4. **API Design & Rate Limiting**
5. **Type Safety & Code Quality**
6. **Performance & Optimization**
7. **Code Organization & Patterns**

---

## üîê 1. Security & Authentication Review

### What to Check:

#### ‚úÖ Current State (Good):
- [x] RLS policies enforced
- [x] Session-based auth (not service role hack)
- [x] OAuth properly implemented

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to Improve:

1. **Input Validation Missing**
   - API route doesn't validate message length/content
   - No sanitization of user input
   - Conversation IDs not validated (UUID format)

2. **Rate Limiting Missing**
   - No rate limiting on `/api/chat`
   - Vulnerable to abuse
   - No cost tracking per user

3. **Error Message Leakage**
   - Some errors expose internal details
   - Stack traces might leak in production

4. **Session Management**
   - No session timeout
   - No refresh token rotation

### Files to Review:
- `app/api/chat/route.ts`
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts`
- `middleware.ts`
- `lib/supabase/schema.sql` (RLS policies)

### Questions to Answer:
- [ ] Are all user inputs validated?
- [ ] Are error messages user-friendly?
- [ ] Is sensitive data never exposed in errors?
- [ ] Are API routes rate-limited?
- [ ] Is authentication properly checked everywhere?

## üõ°Ô∏è 2. Error Handling & Validation

### What to Check:

#### ‚úÖ Current State (Good):
- [x] Custom error classes defined
- [x] Try-catch blocks in place
- [x] Error boundaries for React

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to Improve:

1. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some places throw generic `Error`
   - Some errors not caught properly
   - No centralized error logging

2. **Missing Input Validation**
   - Message content not validated (length, content type)
   - Model names not validated
   - Conversation IDs not validated

3. **Silent Failures**
   - Some errors only console.log (should surface to user)
   - Database save failures don't notify user

### Files to Review:
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` (lines 93-279)
- `lib/db/queries.ts`
- `components/conversation/ConversationClient.tsx`
- `components/homepage/MainInput.tsx`

### Questions to Answer:
- [ ] Are all errors properly handled?
- [ ] Do users see helpful error messages?
- [ ] Are validation errors caught before processing?
- [ ] Is there a logging strategy (not just console.log)?

## üíæ 3. Database Patterns & Data Integrity

### What to Check:

#### ‚úÖ Current State (Good):
- [x] RLS policies protect data
- [x] Foreign key constraints
- [x] Transaction-like patterns where needed

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to Improve:

1. **No Transaction Safety**
   - Creating conversation + saving message not atomic
   - If message save fails, conversation might be orphaned

2. **Race Conditions**
   - `ensureConversation` handles duplicates, but pattern could be cleaner
   - Multiple simultaneous requests might cause issues

3. **Data Validation at DB Level**
   - No check constraints (e.g., message length)
   - No enum validation in DB

4. **Missing Indexes**
   - Check if all query patterns are indexed
   - No composite indexes where needed

### Files to Review:
- `lib/supabase/schema.sql`
- `lib/db/queries.ts`
- `lib/db/queries.server.ts`

### Questions to Answer:
- [ ] Are database operations atomic?
- [ ] Are all queries optimized with indexes?
- [ ] Is data validated at DB level?
- [ ] Are race conditions handled?

## üåê 4. API Design & Rate Limiting

### What to Check:

#### ‚úÖ Current State (Good):
- [x] RESTful API design
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes
- [x] Streaming implemented correctly

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to Improve:

1. **No Rate Limiting**
   - Unlimited API calls possible
   - No cost tracking
   - Vulnerable to abuse

2. **Missing Request Validation**
   - Request body not validated with Zod/schema
   - No max message length check
   - No max messages per request

3. **No Request Timeouts**
   - Long-running requests could hang
   - No timeout handling

4. **Missing Monitoring**
   - No request logging/metrics
   - No performance tracking
   - No error rate monitoring

### Files to Review:
- `app/api/chat/route.ts`

### Questions to Answer:
- [ ] Are requests rate-limited?
- [ ] Are request bodies validated?
- [ ] Are timeouts configured?
- [ ] Is there monitoring/alerting?

---

## üìù 5. Type Safety & Code Quality

### What to Check:

#### ‚úÖ Current State (Good):
- [x] TypeScript strict mode
- [x] Centralized type definitions
- [x] No `any` in most places

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to Improve:

1. **Too Many `any` Types**
   - `app/api/chat/route.ts`: messages typed as `any`
   - `components/conversation/ConversationClient.tsx`: uses `as any`
   - Should use proper types from AI SDK

2. **Missing Type Guards**
   - Runtime type checking missing
   - Could cause runtime errors

3. **ESLint Disables**
   - Some `eslint-disable` comments
   - Should fix underlying issues

### Files to Review:
- All files with `any` types
- All files with `eslint-disable`

### Questions to Answer:
- [ ] Are all types properly defined?
- [ ] Is there any unsafe type casting?
- [ ] Are runtime type checks in place?

## ‚ö° 6. Performance & Optimization

### What to Check:

#### ‚úÖ Current State (Good):
- [x] Server components for initial load
- [x] Streaming for real-time updates
- [x] Database indexes in place

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to Improve:

1. **Missing Caching**
   - No cache for model configs
   - No cache for chat mode configs
   - Repeated lookups

2. **No Pagination**
   - History loads all conversations
   - Messages load all at once
   - Could be slow for power users

3. **Missing Optimistic Updates**
   - UI waits for server response
   - Could show optimistic state

4. **Large Bundle Size**
   - All AI SDK code loaded client-side
   - Could code-split better

### Files to Review:
- `components/layout/history/HistorySidebar.tsx`
- `components/conversation/ConversationClient.tsx`
- `lib/constants.ts` (model configs)

### Questions to Answer:
- [ ] Is data cached where appropriate?
- [ ] Are large datasets paginated?
- [ ] Are bundles optimized?
- [ ] Are queries optimized?

## üèóÔ∏è 7. Code Organization & Patterns

### What to Check:

#### ‚úÖ Current State (Good):
- [x] Clear file structure
- [x] Separation of concerns
- [x] Context pattern for state

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to Improve:

1. **Too Many Console.logs**
   - Debug logs in production code
   - Should use proper logging library
   - Should have log levels

2. **Magic Strings/Numbers**
   - Some hardcoded values
   - Should be constants
   - Configuration not centralized

3. **Missing Documentation**
   - Some functions not documented
   - Complex logic not explained
   - No JSDoc comments

### Files to Review:
- All files (check for console.log)
- Look for magic numbers/strings

### Questions to Answer:
- [ ] Is logging structured?
- [ ] Are magic values extracted to constants?
- [ ] Is code well-documented?
