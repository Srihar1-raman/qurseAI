for context here this qurse is my second rebuild iteration, the currently working and deployed version is qurse-old in desktop folder, qurse-old used hacked together logic messy code nothing is professional there hence rebuilding ground up again, and theres another project with similar usecase by someone else called scira in desktop folder too, scira is professional, scalable, smart, structured codebase. currently in this rebuild ive done the ui, added auth, added bare minimum db with 3 tables,(supabase for both auth and db), ui worked perfectly, even auth with db worked i guess nicely, also ai added ai logic. go through this codebase before i can proceed with the tasks
