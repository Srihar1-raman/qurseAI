for context here this qurse is my second rebuild iteration, the currently working and deployed version is qurse-old in desktop folder, qurse-old used hacked together logic messy code nothing is professional there hence rebuilding ground up again, and theres another project with similar usecase by someone else called scira in desktop folder too, scira is professional, scalable, smart, structured codebase. currently in this rebuild ive done the ui, added auth, added function db with 6 tables,(supabase for both auth and db), also added bare minimum ai logic(routing model registry routing etc). go through this codebase before i can proceed with the tasks, next major task is to complete the rest of the db and business logic after which i'll move onto completing the featureset (chat modes, ai agents, and other functional features), hence agenda today is to complete the db business logic fully, before all that go throught the code base and understand what how where of the codebase, then i'll tell you what to do how to do where to do
